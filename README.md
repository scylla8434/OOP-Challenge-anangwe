# ShakaholaKenya

A personality‑packed virtual pet built with Python OOP and a Tkinter GUI(had to make it fun haha). Feed, play, sleep, and train **ShakaholaKenya** through an interactive window with progress bars and buttons—no console typing required!



## Features

- **Core Stats**: Hunger, Energy & Happiness (0–10).  
- **Actions**:  
  - **Eat**: Lowers hunger, boosts happiness  
  - **Play**: Burns energy, raises happiness, increases hunger  
  - **Sleep**: Restores energy  
- **Trick Training**: Teach custom tricks with duplicate‑check.  
- **GUI**:  
  - `ttk.Progressbar` for real‑time stats  
  - Buttons for each action  
  - Entry + dialog for training & viewing tricks  
- **Console Logging**: All actions still print “before→after” stats in the terminal.
